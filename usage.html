          Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly
          in the computing field. Individual software projects commonly use five
          programming languages or more.[65] Programming languages differ from
          most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater
          degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to
          communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be
          ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be
          understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what
          they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer
          intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a
          program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external
          behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain
          of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an
          algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required
          for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language
          with code written in a programming language. A programming language
          provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the
          operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on
          that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language
          to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts
          are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available
          (called primitives).[66] Programming is the process by which
          programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt
          existing ones to new uses or a changing environment. Programs for a
          computer might be executed in a batch process without human
          interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session
          of an interpreter. In this case the "commands" are simply programs,
          whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its
          commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other
          command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting
          language.
