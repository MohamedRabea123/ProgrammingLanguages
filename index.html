        <h2>Programming language</h2>
        <p>
          A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
          strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming
          languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer
          programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages
          consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines
          that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general
          programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used
          to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes
          and player pianos.[1] The programs for these machines (such as a
          player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response
          to different inputs or conditions.

        <h2>More</h2>
        <p>
          Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and
          more are being created every year. Many programming languages are
          written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to
          perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the
          desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
