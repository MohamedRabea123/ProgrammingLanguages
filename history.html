        <p>
          Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the
          help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry or setting
          banks of physical controls. Slightly later, programs could be written
          in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in a
          numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the
          instruction to add the value in two memory locations might consist of
          3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two
          memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read
          in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on
          switches on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages were
          later termed first-generation programming languages (1GL). The next
          step was the development of the so-called second-generation
          programming languages (2GL) or assembly languages, which were still
          closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific
          computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable
          and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address
          calculations.
